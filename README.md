# Degenerate-Dungeon
Hey losers, welcome to this readme for my super cool and epic Wabbajack modlist for darkest dungeon! Please be aware that this modlist has breasts and pee pee, and is not intended for users under the age of 100. With that being said, lets get started.
- [IMPORTANT](#IMPORTANT)
  - ~~[The steam workshop](#The-Steam-Workshop)~~
  - [The actual modlist](#The-Actual-Modlist)
  - [Juroest Dungeon](
    
# IMPORTANT
## REMEMBER TO HAVE EVERY DLC INSTALLED AND ENABLED
Yes, even the lame multiplayer butchers circus one. Otherwise the game **will** break
## ANTIVIRUS FALSE POSITIVES
Ok so, for some reason this list is triggering some fellas antivirus programs. Just ignore, add exceptions, etc. I promice this list wasnt an elaborate scheme to steal foot pics
## Alpha Notice
This list as it is right now should be considered **VERY** wip for the time being. If you encounter any issues please ping me. I am extreemly lonely
# The Steam Workshop

Note: Probably going to phase out the steam mod collection actually, The juro modpack is a fantastic replacement. However, if you're planning on playing this as a nsfw modlist i highly reccomend you use the following mods

[Monster girl Warrens part 1](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1885424457)
[Monster girl Warrens part 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1906706801)
[Monster girl Brigand part 1](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1927418127)


~~Because almost none of the cool gameplay enhancing mods are actually on the nexus, and are instead on the """fantastic""" steam workshop, i've made a super handy collection to compliment this modlist that you can access here:~~

~~https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2154264537~~

~~Do note that you don't need all of these, unlike with skyrim and whatnot the game wont explode into a million peices if you choose not to have a few mods installed.~~

~~Click [here](https://imgur.com/a/E6eAyPX) for the in game load order for steam mods, for your save file. In order to access this menu, you must first create a save, then click the blue icon to the right of it.~~

~~Note: Because the workshop implentation was very well developed for this game, the mods appear in the order you subscribed to them by default. So do yourself a favour and subscribe to the mods one by one~~



~~# Golly, what are those mods even?~~
## Ui Enhancement~~

~~Jonathan's Xbox One Prompts - Replaces the ps4 buttons with the better and more christian xbox ones.~~

~~## Gameplay Enhancements~~

~~Mods to make the game easier, because good god you'll need em~~

~~**Better Trinkets** - Removes all negative effects from vanilla trinkets.~~

~~**Faster Combat** - Speeds up attack animations~~

~~**Faster Walking** - Speeds up walking from room to room~~

~~**Inventory Stack** - Lets items stack higher~~

~~**Remove Dungeon Level Restriction** - Lets you bring your higher level heroes to low tier dungeons~~

**~~Crimson Curse Buff** - Makes the crimson curse suck less~~

**~~Anti-grind & Larger Roster** - Increaces your roster size and makes the chance of higher level heroes showing up higher~~

**~~Better Boss Rewards** - Makes boss rewards suck less. Also comes with addons for the dlcs and Sunward Isles~~

**~~Nomad Wagon Redone** - Makes the nomad wagon actually useful instead of a thing you look at once and never again.~~

~~## New Dungeons~~

~~**The Sunward Isles** - A japanese themed new land for you to explore. Its really cool. Also has a compatibility patch for The nightmare, and a few addon mods that add more content.~~

## Skins

**Monster girl Warrens part 1 & 2** - Exactly what it looks like.

**Monster girl Brigands** - Yes.

~~## New Monsters~~

~~**Koala's Creature Collection** Adds 17 new enemies. They look cool. Has a patch for the nightmare~~

~~**Beyond Mortality** Adds a bunch of blue eldrich monstrocities to the ruins. Also comes with a cute guy whos good at killing them. Its really cool~~

~~## Marvin Sheos mods~~
None of these have showed up in my game yet so i have no idea if they're good. They probably are though. Just remember to get the shared assets mod as well~~

~~## The Nightmare~~

~~A big collection of mods focusing on endgame content. Its pretty cool. (Important note: All these mods require eachother)~~

~~**The Nightmare** - The main part. Has a patch for the crimson court if you have it installed~~

~~**Better Nightmare Trinkets** Removes all negative effects from the trinkets introduced with this mod~~

~~**The Arena** - You know that butchers circus multiplayer thing they added? This is that but singleplayer~~

Note: Due to the fact i'm ditching the steam workshop almost entirely (exept for those 3 skins), ignore the majority of this. 

# The Actual Modlist

Up in the profile list, you will see an option for 3 versions of the game, which are: Less Booby, More Booby, and Just Booby.

## Less booby
Most sfw version of the modlist, no lustiest lair, sfw versions of all mods and uses Juroest Dungeon

## More booby
Reccomended version of the modlist, uses Juroest dungeon and has the most NSFW content.

## Just booby
Same as more, but instead of juro it uses lustiest lair. No you can't use both it will make the game explode

## New Classes
Check the Juroest Dungeon mod [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/mods/1021?tab=description) for information about the classes it adds.

Other than that, this list has all the profligates and Tifa Lockheart from [Muscarine](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/330348?tab=user+files)

Also a good majority of them have been reskinned to be far more cute by [Jefuty](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/2034155?tab=user+files)

Underneath the Profligates, you will notice that theres 3 versions of "Jef's MOD Hero Collection". The normal version features almost no lewdness for the profligates, and just makes them cute, the lewd version does. The hardcore edition, however, adds some kinky bdsm stuff to a few of the heroes. If that aint your thing just use Lewd.

Finally, i've added 2B. My reasons are obvious.

## Town People Skins

In this section are reskins for all the town npcs, created by [NIUR](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/64319641?tab=user+files)

All of them are epic and have been installed in two flavours: Normal and Lewd. Theres also usually a third version of all of these featuring **TENTACLE SEX** but i decided not to install em because they werent very immersive. You can do that yourself.

Theres also a Maid version of the stagecoach npc thats enabled by default, as well as the normal one. The reason for this being that the maid version is adorable. If you would rather switch to regular, just disable it and enable he normal version.

## Minor skins

Most of these were created by [AlcorRadiance](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/91003303?tab=user+files)

All of these can be reinstalled to your tastes rather easily, by right clicking them and clicking reinstall.

There is also a replacer for the skeleton fella in the bottom right and left of your screen in dungeons, with a breast version and a christian and pure non breast version. Both can be customised as you wish

## Monster Skins

Most of these were created by [StalinTheStalin](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/4913083?tab=user+files&BH=0)

Only thing of note is that the crystalline mod has a version with and without futa. Choose what you want, it only effects two enemies anyway.

Theres also a replacer for the skeleton enemies as well made by [AIRHOC](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/91445153?tab=user+files). Personally i find them adorable, hence their inclusion. [ALSO ONE OF THE REPLACED SKELETONS IS SANS](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/650401195411636224/729154961820090429/SPOILER_skeleton_captain.sprite.attack_mace.png)

## Hero Skins

These have been created by [NIUR](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/64319641?tab=user+files), [Xelsword](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/79892533?tab=user+files), and [Jefuty](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/2034155?tab=user+files)

**IMPORTANT**
Due to the way Xelswords skins work, you cannot use them and another one for the same hero at the same time, or else the skin will literally explode


## Lustiest Lair

https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/mods/931

Ok so, this ones a bit of a doozie. Essentially its a massive overhaul to the entire game to make it far more lewd, by way of new bosses, changed ability descriptions, new lewd curios, etc. Only problem is that it probably conflicts a lot with the rest of the list. Enable it if you want, personally it works fine*.

Warning: For your own sanity, only enable this mod *after* you complete the first tutorial mission, otherwise your two heroes will be enslaved by dogs. What fun!

Warning 2: Do not enable the UI mod and Lustiest Lair at the same time. It breaks things

## Save editor

Say what you will, but i find losing heroes really lame. Hence why i've included a nifty little save editor. Below are instructions on how to use it.
1. Back up your saves for the love of god
2. Open the save editor and go to roster
3. Right click, collapse all folds, then expand until you make it to the heroes section
4. hover your mouse over each + to the left of the numbers, to see which hero they represent, then find the ones you want to resurrect
5. Change roster status from 3 to 0
6. Save and exit

Assuming you followed these instructions, you will have either lost your save, or have your heroes back.
