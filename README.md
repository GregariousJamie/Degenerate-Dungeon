# Degenerate-Dungeon
Hey redditors, you're *probably* seeing this because you've started downloading and installing my modlist (good on you!). That being said, this list does need a little bit of configuration on your part to work properly, so read on please. (Also, be sure to ping me if theres any issues with this list. I am the only mod author who is ok with this for some reason)
    
# Installation
Adjust the Installation Location to a directory located on the root directory of one of your drives

For example, this might be "C:\Degenerate", "D:\Degenerate", etc.

Ensure the Download Location is within that directory

Click the Go/Begin button

Wait for Wabbajack to finish

**Gonna make this bit huge for a reason:**
## MAKE SURE YOU HAVE **ALL** THE OFFICAL DLC ENABLED(Yes, even butchers circus)
While this list will probably work without them, certain optional mods (such as lustiest lair or the fallen heroes mod) likely won't function correctly

Other than that, installation is the same as any other list, just move the contents of game folder files to your darkest dungeon directory, and launch the game through the mod organiser.exe located in the installation directory.

Also, because this happened once, dont disable the crimson court dlc. yes it warns you, no you shouldnt disable it.

Also, to enable the steam mods (and lustiest lair) that you've transpalanted into the game (read below sections), you must click the blue icon after creating a new save, then enable the mods. If said mods require some form of hierachy to function correctly, they can be dragged and dropped into any order.

# Optional post installation mods
## Loverslab
Due to a combination of my awful australian internet, and loverslabs servers not being the best, i am genuinely unable to actually compile loverslab mods in this list, meaning that if you want some additional great skins, you'll have to add them manually. Please direct any and all complaints to our prime minister

Below are links to Dan_'s **many** mods for DD, in which i'm sure you will find something you'll love. I recomend the replacers for townspeople, additional skins for heroes, and the Sexy Fallen Heroes mod (just be aware that it is painfully difficult). 

(Please note that i am not responsible for any changes you make to the list, blah blah blah etc, you get the drill. That being said, most these are just texture mods so nothing should go too badly.)

## The Steam Workshop
There are a **ton** of great nsfw mods (and actual content additions) on steam, and i made a somewhat ok complation of them a long time ago, but i reccomend you go find stuff on your own as well. [The compilation in question](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2264507822).

Keep in mind that these **will** overwrite the mods in mod organiser unless you move the mod folders into mod organisers 'mods' folder. This will work fine for simple texture replacers, but dlc sized mods may require a bit of file structure magic.

If you add a mod that adds additional heroes for example, I would reccomend that you make the following folder structure:

`<your degenerate dungeon installation>/mods/<Name of mod>/mods/<the actual mod>`.

(See how the Lustiest lair mod is structured for an example).

Steam mods need to be manually enabled upon making a new save. You're on your own when it comes to sorting piorities on them but they should be fine.

Additionally, Dan_ has made quite a number of texture replaces for steam mods. If you use these then i recomend that you either just replace the original mod files with those, *or* remake the file structure with the replacer files in it. Either will work, but the first method is much less clean.

# Other important information

## Game unhardening
In order to make stuff more fun, i have made it so that all the classes can use all 7 skills at once (and let me tell you, that was way more complicated than you would think). Also journal pages autosave (meaning that you just have to read them once, and then you can throw them away to save inventory space) and you have 36 inventory slots (The implentation of this *is* a bit buggy in regards to right clicking to use items on objects. If in doubt just drag and drop items into the interaction boxes).

## Skins (and the fantastic artists behind them)

The majority of this list is just texture replacers for npcs, heroes, and monsters. I'll list the notable artists below

[NIUR](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/64319641?tab=user+files) has created **tons** of replacers for just about every hero and town npc. 

[AlcorRadiance](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/91003303?tab=user+files) has made skins replacing most inventory icons such as the gems, busts, portraits and the map.

[StalinTheStalin](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/4913083?tab=user+files&BH=0) has created most of the replacers for enemies (and they are **adorable!**). 

[AIRHOC](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/91445153?tab=user+files) has replaced the skeletons in the game with anime girls. They're cute.

[Xelsword](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/79892533?tab=user+files) has also made replacers for heroes, but their ones are much more complicated as they use custom skeletons (which also means you can't use other skins with them).

[Jefuty](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/2034155?tab=user+files) has made a whole bunch of replacers for npcs, background objects, monsters, and heroes

Important note: I have included several alternate versions of mods with varying levels of lewdness, or thick cocks. These can be switched between easily by disabling and enabling mods.

## Lustiest Lair

https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/mods/931

Ok so, this ones a bit of a doozie. Essentially its a massive overhaul to the entire game to make it far more lewd, by way of new bosses, changed ability descriptions, new lewd curios, etc. Its not for everyone but can be enabled when making a new save. (Just don't remove it on a save that has already been using it, horrific things **will** ocour).

## Save editor

Say what you will, but i find losing heroes to random bullshit unpleasent. Hence why i've included a nifty little save editor. Below are instructions on how to use it.
1. Back up your saves for the love of god
2. Open the save editor and go to roster
3. Right click, collapse all folds, then expand until you make it to the heroes section
4. hover your mouse over each + to the left of the numbers, to see which hero they represent, then find the ones you want to resurrect
5. Change roster status from 3 to 0
6. Save and exit

Assuming you followed these instructions, you will have either lost your save, or have your heroes back.
