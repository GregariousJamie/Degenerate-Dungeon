# Degenerate-Dungeon
Hey losers, welcome to this readme for my super cool and epic Wabbajack modlist for darkest dungeon! Please be aware that this modlist has breasts and pee pee, and is not intended for users under the age of 100. With that being said, lets get started.

# Preamble
## The Steam Workshop
Because almost none of the cool gameplay enhancing mods are actually on the nexus, and are instead on the """fantastic""" steam workshop, i've made a super handy collection to compliment this modlist that you can access here:

Do note that you don't need all of these, unlike with skyrim and whatnot the game wont explode into a million peices if you choose not to have a few mods installed.
