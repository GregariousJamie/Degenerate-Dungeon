# IMPORTANT
## REMEMBER TO HAVE EVERY DLC INSTALLED AND ENABLED
Yes, even the lame multiplayer butchers circus one. Otherwise the game **will** break
## ANTIVIRUS FALSE POSITIVES
Ok so, for some reason this list is triggering some fellas antivirus programs. Just ignore, add exceptions, etc. I promice this list wasnt an elaborate scheme to steal foot pics
## Alpha Notice
This list as it is right now should be considered **VERY** wip for the time being. If you encounter any issues please ping me. I am extreemly lonely
# The Steam Workshop

Note: Probably going to phase out the steam mod collection actually, The juro modpack is a fantastic replacement. However, if you're planning on playing this as a nsfw modlist i highly reccomend you use the following mods

[Monster girl Warrens part 1](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1885424457)
[Monster girl Warrens part 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1906706801)

# Juroest Dungeon
150 steam mods bundled together and patched to work with eachother. It makes the game so much better. Read more about it [here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/mods/1021?tab=description)

# The Actual Modlist

Up in the profile list, you will see an option for 3 versions of the game, which are: Less Booby, More Booby, and Just Booby.

## Less booby
Most sfw version of the modlist, no lustiest lair, sfw versions of all mods and uses Juroest Dungeon

## More booby
Reccomended version of the modlist, uses Juroest dungeon and has the most NSFW content.

## Just booby
Same as more, but instead of juro it uses lustiest lair. No you can't use both it will make the game explode

## New Trinkets
Cultist Simulator makes me horny, so i added a mod based on it. If you don't like it you can disable it easily 

## New Classes
Check the Juroest Dungeon mod [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/mods/1021?tab=description) for information about the classes it adds.

Other than that, this list has all the profligates and Tifa Lockheart from [Muscarine](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/330348?tab=user+files)

Also a good majority of them have been reskinned to be far more cute by [Jefuty](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/2034155?tab=user+files)

Underneath the Profligates, you will notice that theres 3 versions of "Jef's MOD Hero Collection". The normal version features almost no lewdness for the profligates, and just makes them cute, the lewd version does. The hardcore edition, however, adds some kinky bdsm stuff to a few of the heroes. If that aint your thing just use Lewd.

Finally, i've added 2B. My reasons are obvious.

## Town People Skins

In this section are reskins for all the town npcs, created by [NIUR](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/64319641?tab=user+files)

All of them are epic and have been installed in two flavours: Normal and Lewd. Theres also usually a third version of all of these featuring **TENTACLE SEX** but i decided not to install em because they werent very immersive. You can do that yourself.

Theres also a Maid version of the stagecoach npc thats enabled by default, as well as the normal one. The reason for this being that the maid version is adorable. If you would rather switch to regular, just disable it and enable he normal version.

## Minor skins

Most of these were created by [AlcorRadiance](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/91003303?tab=user+files)

All of these can be reinstalled to your tastes rather easily, by right clicking them and clicking reinstall.

There is also a replacer for the skeleton fella in the bottom right and left of your screen in dungeons, with a breast version and a christian and pure non breast version. Both can be customised as you wish

## Monster Skins

Most of these were created by [StalinTheStalin](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/4913083?tab=user+files&BH=0)

Only thing of note is that the crystalline mod has a version with and without futa. Choose what you want, it only effects two enemies anyway.

Theres also a replacer for the skeleton enemies as well made by [AIRHOC](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/91445153?tab=user+files). Personally i find them adorable, hence their inclusion. [ALSO ONE OF THE REPLACED SKELETONS IS SANS](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/650401195411636224/729154961820090429/SPOILER_skeleton_captain.sprite.attack_mace.png)

## Hero Skins

These have been created by [NIUR](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/64319641?tab=user+files), [Xelsword](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/79892533?tab=user+files), and [Jefuty](https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/users/2034155?tab=user+files)

**IMPORTANT**
Due to the way Xelswords skins work, you cannot use them and another one for the same hero at the same time, or else the skin will literally explode


## Lustiest Lair

https://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/mods/931

Ok so, this ones a bit of a doozie. Essentially its a massive overhaul to the entire game to make it far more lewd, by way of new bosses, changed ability descriptions, new lewd curios, etc. Only problem is that it probably conflicts a lot with the rest of the list. Enable it if you want, personally it works fine*.

Warning: For your own sanity, only enable this mod *after* you complete the first tutorial mission, otherwise your two heroes will be enslaved by dogs. What fun!

## Save editor

Say what you will, but i find losing heroes really lame. Hence why i've included a nifty little save editor. Below are instructions on how to use it.
1. Back up your saves for the love of god
2. Open the save editor and go to roster
3. Right click, collapse all folds, then expand until you make it to the heroes section
4. hover your mouse over each + to the left of the numbers, to see which hero they represent, then find the ones you want to resurrect
5. Change roster status from 3 to 0
6. Save and exit

Assuming you followed these instructions, you will have either lost your save, or have your heroes back.

# Actually playing the game
The instructions for this will be different depending on which profile you're using, but in short;

**Less Booby** - Start a new save, enable all the dlc, then click the blue cirlce button thing on the right to oepn the mods menu. Enable the juro mods and have 0 first, 1 second, etc.

**More Booby** - Same as above

**Just Booby** - Just start playing
